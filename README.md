# Health and Fitness Club (Project 2) - COMP 3005 Final Project

## How it works
The Health and Fitness Club was created using Java. This program can be run using the command-line interface. There are 3 main classes that contain the majority of the functions. The Main class contains functions for logging in and authentication, the Admin class contains functions used by an admin user, the Trainer class contains functions used by a trainer user, and the Member class contains functions used by a member user. All member variables and class functions were made private so that outside classes cannot change other userâ€™s data.

## How to run it
1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure you have IntelliJ, PostgreSQL, and pgAdmin installed on your machine
3. Open the `healthAndFitnessClub` project in IntelliJ
4. Create a new database called `FinalProject` in pgAdmin. Change lines 12 and 13 of the Main class with the username and password to your database.
5. Open the Main class and click the run button at the top right corner of the screen
6. Observe that the program runs in the command line interface

**Please note that since YouTube only allows videos under 15 minutes to be posted, I have sped up the original video. Please feel free to slow it down by changing the playback speed to 0.5 or 0.75. Thank you for your understanding :)**
